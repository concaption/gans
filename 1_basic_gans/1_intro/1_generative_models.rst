### Generative Models
---
Generative models and discriminative models sit on opposite ends of the machine learning spectrum, each with its own flair and utility. Discriminative models, the workhorses of classification, are all about drawing boundaries. Given some features \( X \), they aim to predict a label \( Y \). They don't care about painting the full picture; they just want to tell you if it's a cat or a dog based on features like a wet nose or purring.

On the flip side, generative models are the artists. They don't classify; they create. Feed them some noise and optionally a class label, and they'll give you something that looks like it belongs to that class. Why the noise? It introduces randomness into the creation process. So, every run gives you a new "art piece," whether it's a Pekingese or a Tibetan Mastiff.

Two heavy hitters in the generative arena are Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). VAEs are like a two-step process. First, an encoder compresses an image into a latent space. Then a decoder reconstructs it. Add some statistical noise in the mix, and voila, you've got a VAE.

GANs are more like a duel between a forger and an art critic. The generator (forger) creates images from random noise. The discriminator (critic) tries to tell if they're real or fake. They keep going at it until the generator is so good, the discriminator can't tell the difference. No more need for the discriminator; the generator can now create art on its own.

The kicker? Discriminative models can be part of generative models. In a GAN, the discriminator is essentially a discriminative model. It's like a machine learning inception.

We'll be diving deep into GANs in this course. By the end of the week, you'll even have your own GAN sketching out handwritten digits. So, buckle up; it's going to be a fascinating ride.
